# World-Happiness-Analysis

A data analysis project exploring global happiness using the World Happiness Report (and related socio-economic / well-being data). The analysis investigates which factors correlate with happiness across countries and how happiness trends evolve over time.

## 📄 Project Overview

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the World Happiness Report dataset (and optionally augmented data) to explore global happiness distributions, trends, and drivers.  
- Visualize relationships between happiness scores and indicators like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, corruption/trust, etc.  
- Provide insights into what contributes to a nation’s “happiness score” and how it changes year-to-year / region-to-region.
